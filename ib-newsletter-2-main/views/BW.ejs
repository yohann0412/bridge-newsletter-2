Luckily with the Big Write bridge module headed by Mrs. Julia Robertson and Mrs. Srividhya Sathyamurthy not only released us of the fear of EE but also equipped us with the skills needed to successfully sail through our extended essay.

Big Write teaches us the importance of having the ability to translate one’s ideas, inclinations and thought processes into words with enough skill and efficiency. Exploring topics we never knew we would find interesting not only boosted our perspectives but also broadened our creativity!
