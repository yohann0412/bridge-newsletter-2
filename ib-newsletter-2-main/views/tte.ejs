                    <p class="sub-title pad-bt15"> The famous author Ken Poirot had rightly said<i> “ Wise people understand the
                    need to consult experts; only fools are confident they know everything” </i>and our “Talk to the Expert” sessions have been built on this foundation. The immense energy and engagement involved between the expert and the students make these sessions very interesting and highly popular too. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="sub-title pad-bt15">Last week we had our very own Vice Principal, John Gomes Sir come and speak to us about the 7 habits of highly effective people. It was a very enriching,enlightening and an interactive session .Mr Gomes explained the 7 habits in detail and he also spoke about Steven Covey’s 4 quadrants on time management.

                        This week we were supposed to have a talk with Mr.Daniel Adkins,the CEO of Curtis University. Mr.Daniel has actually come to our school in 2019 where he spoke to the 11th graders regarding “what universities look for in undergraduate students” . He was going to give us a very insightful talk about Future jobs. 
                        Unfortunately a fire broke out during the lunch break on Monday which led to the session being cancelled. We hope to see you soon Mr Daniel.
