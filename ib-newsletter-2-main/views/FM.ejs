                    <p class="sub-title pad-bt15">The flexi module is a vital part of the IB bridge that ensures that academics and fun are placed on an equal pedestal. Visual Arts, Music, Dance and P.E are the various activities that this module provides. The teachers – Ms.Jignyasa , Ms.Rahila, Mr.Axel and Mr.Jaison are all highly skilled and passionate about what they teach. This week in Visual Arts Ms.Jignyasa gave us a few prompts to work on whilst showing us examples of previous Visual Art student’s portfolios. Visual arts is personally my favourite module as we have the freedom to listen to music during class and roam around to gather ideas for our compositions.

                        There are no restrictions to ideas, and we are truly allowed to express ourselves through any visual media we prefer. The music students this week learnt about body repercussions i.e making beats and rhythms with different parts of their body like their hands, legs, stomach etc. They also started an introduction to a music application called “Audacity” where they will be learning how to record and make music and audio edits. The dance students continued learning choreographies based on Hip Hop and Bhangra.

                        In P.E Mr.Jaison taught us how to serve in Tennis and how to tackle different shots. The Flexi Module is a great getaway from the hustle and bustle of school work and helps us develop passion and step out of our comfort zone.
